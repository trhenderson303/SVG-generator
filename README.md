## Description
This command line application uses the Inquirer npm to accept user input and compile the responses to automatically generaten a vector logo. Users must select a shape for their logo - either circle, square, or triangle - and can choose up to three letters to include in the logo. Users can also specify the color of both the shape and text. The application formats the user's input and writes it to an SVG file.
